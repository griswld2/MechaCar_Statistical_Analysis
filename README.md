The current linear model used to predict mpg of the MechaCar does it uneffectively. Although the R^2 value and the adjusted R^2 value are high, we leveraged many variables which naturally causes a higher correlation. Future analyses should include a feature selection in order to limit the variables used to provide a more predictive analytical model.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The current manufacturing lots in total meet the requirement. The variance seen on PSI is < 100. However, when grouping by the lots, Lot 3 does not meet the requirement of having a PSI variance < 100. The PSI variance on Lot 3 is 170.29.
